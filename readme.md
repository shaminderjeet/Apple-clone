This is the project we started in class. The assignment is to create a replica of the home page of Apple. The main goals are:

A) Create a navbar and page with images.
B) Make it responsive (should look good on mobile, tablet, desktop).

Don't worry about it being perfect. The goal is to practice flexbox, media queries, and general CSS! Focus on the top parts of the page, not the footer.
I used extraction.io website for extracting images
I make the website to make it more responsive
